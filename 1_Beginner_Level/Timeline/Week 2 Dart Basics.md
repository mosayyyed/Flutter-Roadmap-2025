## Tasks:

### **Task 1:**
- Watch and understand the concepts from the provided Dart playlist (videos 01 to 54).
- Solve the following problems:

#### **Problem 1:**  
Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Print out a message that tells how many years they have to be 100 years old.

#### **Problem 2:**  
Ask the user for a number and determine whether the number is even or not.

#### **Problem 3:**  
Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number.

#### **Problem 4:**  
Take a list, say for example:  
`a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]`  
Write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 5.

#### **Problem 5:**  
Write a program that takes a list of numbers, for example:  
`a = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]`  
Make a new list of only the first and last elements of the given list.  
**Hint:** Write this code inside a function.

#### **Problem 6:**  
Given a list of integers, write a function that finds the max and min integers in the list, without using any library functions in Dart.
